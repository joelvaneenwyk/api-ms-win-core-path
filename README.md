# `api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0.dll`

This is an implementation of `api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0.dll` based on Wine code. It is made to run Python 3.9 on Windows 7.

## Description

For Blender 3.0 and above, see <https://github.com/nalexandru/BlenderCompat>

Blender 2.93 fails to start on Windows 7 because it uses Python 3.9 which requires `api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0.dll`.

## Blender 2.93 installation on Windows 7

The official installer will refuse to install on Windows 7.

You can download the Portable Zip or if you prefer the installer you can download a modified version that lowers the requirement from [modified installer download](https://1drv.ms/u/s%21AhpnXywMA4U1mQHBW0R_xWClYKBP?e=YgUSLj), or you can modify the .MSI file ([instructions on how to modify the MSI](http://david-merritt.blogspot.com/2012/08/force-blocked-software-to-install-onto.html)).

## Installation

* Clone and build it yourself or download a pre-compiled release.
* Copy the x64 dll into Blender's installation directory or copy the x86 dll into C:\Windows\SysWOW64 and the x64 dll into C:\Windows\System32.

After that it should work.
